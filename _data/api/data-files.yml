    summary: "For large plugins that potentially store massive amounts of data, using a single data file may not be advisable.  In this case, uMod provides the ability to store many smaller data files in a custom sub-directory.  These smaller data files may be loaded on an as-needed basis, thus reducing the impact of a plugin on memory and the filesystem overall"

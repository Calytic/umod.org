  questions:
    - question: "What is the uMod project?"
      answer: "uMod is essentially what Oxide was planned to be: advanced self-patching (no bundles), an extended universal API, extensive documentation, support for additional games, a new home, and more."
    - question: "What is the Oxide mod?"
      answer: "Oxide is a mod project that started in late 2013, which was originally only for Rust. Basic support was later added for other Unity and .NET games as well as support for other programming languages."
    - question: "Where can I get plugins?"
      answer: "You can find all of the existing plugins for Oxide at oxidemod.org; these will eventually be updated for uMod along with a standalone site and repository. For new plugins, check out the Plugins section."
    - question: "When will X game be supported?"
      answer: "A game being supported depends on if it's written in a compatible programming language and isn't jumbled up. Feel free to post a request on our forums or issue tracker and we'll take a look!"
    - question: "When will an update be available for X game?"
      answer: "If support for a game is somehow outdated, we've either ran into an issue with the update or we haven't been able to get to it. Rest assured it'll be available ASAP!"
    - question: "How do I submit a plugin I made?"
      answer: "Currently we are not accepting new plugins until the existing plugins have been migrated from oxidemod.org. Once that is done, we'll have information about submitting new plugins."
    - question: "Why do some plugin hooks not work after updating?"
      answer: "If you updated to a newer game update and not all uMod features are working, that's likely because there were changes that affected it and would need to be reviewed by a team member and a patch be pushed out."

  questions:
    - question: "Which hosts support uMod?"

            How can a developer reproduce the bug on their own system?
            <br /><br />
            Steps to reproduce are the most important part of any bug report. If a developer is able to reproduce the bug, the bug will very likely be fixed.
            <br /><br />
            If the steps are unclear, it might not even be possible to know whether a bug can be fixed.
